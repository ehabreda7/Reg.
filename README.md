# Reg.
## This Code Is for a Model Using Regression Method In ML Using One Variable.
### This How The Code Works:
1. Importing Libraries
2. Reading Data
3. Showing Data Details
4. Drawing Data
5. Adding a New Column Called ones Before The Data
6. Separate X (training data) from y (target variable)
7. Convert from Data Frames to Numpy Matrices
8. Calculate Cost Function
9. Calculate GD Function
10. Initialize Variables for Learning Rate and Iterations
11. Performing Gradient Descent to "fit" The Model Parameters
12. Getting Best Fit Line
13. Drawing The Line
14. Drawing Error Graph 
### And That Was a Regression Model for Population Using One Variables.
